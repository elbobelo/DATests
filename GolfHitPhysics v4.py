'''
This code simulates the flight of a golf ball based on the club's loft angle, mass, and speed.
The ball's horizontal and vertical position are updated at each time step.
The loop continues until the ball hits the ground (vertical position becomes negative)
or the simulation time exceeds the maximum time. The maximum height and total distance traveled
by the ball are calculated and printed out. The drag coefficient (Cd), air density (rho), and spin rate
are constants that can be adjusted to simulate different ball types and clubs.
The coefficient of restitution (COR) is also used to simulate energy loss on impact.
The distance is converted from meters to yards at the end.
